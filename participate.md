# Participate

Thank you for your interest in participating in our studies. Before you sign up for a study, here's a few things you should know:

## No-Show Policy

In order to ensure that everyone who's interested in participating gets a chance to participate, please be aware that if you sign up for a study and can no longer make it to the study, you have to cancel your appointment at least <b>24 hours</b> before your appointment. Our scheduling program will easily allow you to do this. <b>If an emergency comes up</b> and you have to cancel last minute, <b>send us an email</b> to let us know.

If you are a no-show <b>twice</b> for a study, <b>you will no longer be able to sign up for any studies</b>. Please come <b>on time</b> for your appointment. If you arrive more than 10 minutes after your scheduled appointment, you will be considered a no-show.

## Scheduling

Once you have read this page and click participate, you will be taken to our scheduling page. The page will ask you for a username and password. You will use your IU username but <b>not your UMD passphrase</b> for security reasons. Instead, if you do not already have a password, <b>click "Request Account"</b> on the lower right-hand corner of the page to request a password. You should then receive a temporary password in your email. If you haven't received your temporary password within an hour, please email us at groupslab@umd.edu.

## Extra Slots

Depending on the particular study, we may allow several extra sign-ups per session in order to make sure we have enough people. If we've already filled a session before you arrive, you will be given the option to complete an alternative study for compensation. We encourage you to reschedule your appointment for the original study that you've signed up for in these cases.

## Participate

Now that you're aware of our policies, please click the "Participate" button below and you'll be taken to our scheduling page. Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments. Thank you again for your interest in participating.
